    ### üí° How This Calculator Works
    
    **Fixed Interest Rate**: Uses a single interest rate throughout the loan period.
    
    **Manual Payment**: You choose how much to pay each month.
    
    **Daily Interest Calculation**: Interest is calculated based on actual days in each month.
    
    **Year-end Bonus**: Optional additional payment at the end of each year.
    
    ---
    
    ### üìä Key Features
    - Simple and straightforward
    - Fixed monthly payments
    - Flexible payment amounts
    - Yearly bonus payments
    
    ---
    
    ### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
    - Monthly payment must cover interest
    - Lower payments = longer loan term
    - Higher payments = shorter loan term
    - Interest calculated daily for accuracy
